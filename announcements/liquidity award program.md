# **Liquidity Award Program**

## What is it?

- $14M TON liquidity award program for teams deploying on TON and bringing users to increase the total value locked (TVL) in the ecosystem (e.g., bridge, DEX, etc.)
- **6-month cliff and 12-month vesting**
- Rewards will be unlocked on a first-come, first-served basis ranging from $150,000 TON to $3,500,000 TON (paid out in TON)

## Additional Guidelines (Examples Only)

Additional guidelines are set in place to prevent cheating. Here are some examples that will be considered:

- Active users (MAU example below)
  - Tier 1: 5,000 - 20,000
  - Tier 2: 50,000 - 100,000
  - Tier 3: 120,000+
- Liquidity of the locked values (i.e., reputability of the projects behind the Jettons added to the pool)
- Website traffic
- Number of wallets
- Number of unique participants

## Terms

- 1-year window with fixed TON price ($1.00)
- Post 1-year window vesting will be at the trailing 1-month average TON spot price
- 6-month cliff and 12-month vesting
- Awards vested monthly starting from the half-year mark (e.g. T+6 (months)) based on time-weighted average TVL (rolling 6-months lookback)
- During the vesting period, TVL must stay above 50% of the highest level achieved - otherwise vesting is paused
- Teams must provide information about the protocol via GitHub pull request and public TVL reporting  

## Conditions

- Initial approval by TON Society and pre-determined start date (T+0) & lookback date (T+6) required
- Sum of funds deposited in the contract must be liquid tokens 
- Definition of liquid tokens for TVL calculation is up to the discretion of TON Society (e.g., major stablecoins, wrapped BTC, TON, etc.)

## Awards Usage

While we do not place restrictions on the awards usage (whether the team reinvests back into the protocol or funds another project), any report that the award is misused in a way that is negative to the ecosystem will be subject to review and result in possible termination of rewards.

*T&C subject to change at the discretion of TON Society, based on community feedback.* *Guidelines will factor in as needed (e.g., heavy concentration of LTV in small number of MAU will be subject to further inquiries).*
